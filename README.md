# Country Items API

This project is an API that provides data on the prices (in USD) of common items in various countries. It is designed for learning purposes but offers an interesting insight into price comparisons across different regions. The API consists of two tables: the public table and the private table. The private table contains the initial data uploaded by me, while the public table, which starts with the same data, can be modified by any registered and logged-in user.

## Features

- Retrieve item prices for different countries
- Modify public table data by registered users
- User registration and login functionality

## Tools and Technologies

- **FastAPI**: For building the API
- **Heroku**: For deploying the application
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database
- **Git**: For version control
- **Postman**: For testing the API

## Skills Learned

- Building and deploying APIs with FastAPI
